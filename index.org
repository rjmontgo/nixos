* NixOS

For work / personal computers I want to have the following folder
structure the basic idea is that the home manager should be common
across all systems contain xdg configs. Where as the system config
should handle all packages be separate (manages
homebrew/java/node/etc)

can parameterize things to the home manager like username where
needed.  Should be a set of modules that are 'opt-in' meaning that
each home configuration can select from a set of modules where
differences are needed.

        /core.nix
        /default.nix?
        /config
                /(yabai|zsh|skhd)/file
  ./hosts
        /bluecrew.nix
        /mactop.nix
